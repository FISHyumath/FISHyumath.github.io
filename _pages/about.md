I am a second-year Ph.D. advised by Prof. [Jishen Zhao](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jzhao/) in Computer Science and Engineering Department of UC San Diego, starting in 2022. I am now aiming to build efficient systems for machine learning. Before coming to UCSD, I received my B.E. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University.
I have a broad interest in combining machine learning and computer systems, with a special focus on designing hardware-efficient algorithms. I have previously focused on more acceleration for GNN workloads and devoted myself to some open-source projects like [dgSPARSE](https://dgsparse.github.io/) and [CogDL](https://cogdl.ai/). Some topics that I have been working on are listed below:

- High-performance GPU Kernels(e.g. SpMM, SDDMM, Fused-Attention)
- End-to-end optimization for sparse ML models including Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks, Graph Neural Networks, etc.
- Machine Learning Compiler
- In/Near-Storage Computing

Feel free to contact me if you share any common interests.
